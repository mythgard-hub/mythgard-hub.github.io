      While many parts of Mythgard will feel familiar to experienced card game players, two features in particular deserve attention in getting started with the game: The resource system and the Game Board itself. Cards are sorted into one of six colors—Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, Orange, and Purple—and will have a cost represented with both Gems and Mana. Cards in hand can also be “burned” giving you one additional Mana and one additional Gem to spend each turn. Because of this flexible resource system, there are no dedicated resource cards and gameplay and deck design can more fluidly and smoothly evolve without having to worry about balancing resource cards. Cards can only be burned once and a burned card can be identified by the right-hand gem being broken. Upon being burned, a card is reinserted into the deck.. Mana can also be used to activate player Powers. Some Minions and Artifacts also have abilities that can be activated by paying a cost of Gems, Mana, or both.
