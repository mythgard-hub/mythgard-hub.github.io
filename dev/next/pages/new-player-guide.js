            . Rhino Games is currently focusing all efforts on rolling out Open
            Beta, but localization is on the roadmap for some point in the
            future and as the game grows, it may also expand to consoles!
          </p>

          <h1>
            <span id="Game_Overview">Game Overview</span>
          </h1>

          <p>
            While many parts of Mythgard will feel familiar to experienced card
            game players, two features in particular deserve attention in
            getting started with the game: The resource system and the Game
            Board itself. Cards are sorted into one of six colors—Blue, Yellow,
            Red, Green, Orange, and Purple—and will have a cost represented with
            both Gems and Mana. Cards in hand can also be “burned” giving you
            one additional Mana and one additional Gem to spend each turn.
            Because of this flexible resource system, there are no dedicated
            resource cards and gameplay and deck design can more fluidly and
            smoothly evolve without having to worry about balancing resource
            cards. Cards can only be burned once and a burned card can be
            identified by the right-hand gem being broken. Upon being burned, a
            card is reinserted into the deck.. Mana can also be used to activate
            player Powers. Some Minions and Artifacts also have abilities that
            can be activated by paying a cost of Gems, Mana, or both.{' '}
          </p>
        </div>
        <img
          className="article"
          src="https://teamrankstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/guide1.png"
        />
        <div className="article_caption">
          Your Gem Bar shows the Gems you have available and your Mana Circle

        </div>
        <div className="articles_column">
          <p>
            The Game Board itself functions like the Battlefield in Magic, a
            place where Minions are summoned and combat takes place. What is
            specific to this zone in Mythgard blocking is determined by position
            rather than keywords or phases of combat. The board itself is
            divided into 7 Lanes for each player, and minions must be played
            into one of these Lanes. Minions may attack into any of the three
            opposing lanes but may be required to first dispatch opposing
            minions before directly attacking the opponent. These Lanes can also
            host Enchantments, providing a variety of useful effects to minions
            which occupy the lane or the board itself. Effect on Minions range
            from simple bonuses to health or attack to granting special
            abilities to minions, and the Enchantments can nullify abilities on
            opposing minions or return Minions to play after being destroyed!
            The destruction of an occupying Minion does not remove Enchantments,
            so they can be used again by future Minions, though there are spells
            and effects which can destroy Enchantments.

          <h3>
            <span id="Card_Types">Card Types</span>
          </h3>

          <p>The cards in your collection fit into four categories:</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Minions:</strong> Summons a Minion into one of your
            unoccupied lanes. Minions have a value for Strength and Health, and
            some have Awaken effects which trigger when they enter play or
            Demise effects which trigger when they enter the Boneyard. Strength
            value determines damage dealt in combat with other minions and the
            opponent. When a Minion’s Health is reduced to zero, it is sent to
            the Boneyard.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Spells:</strong> A one-time effect which may generate a
            variety of effects, possibly targeting Cards, Players, or Lanes.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Enchantments:</strong> A permanent effect which targets one
            of your seven lanes, providing bonuses to the occupying minion or
            imposing penalties on opposing minions.

            <strong>Artifacts:</strong> Cards which can provide both continuous
            and activated bonuses and effects for a Player while they are in
            play. A player may only have five Artifacts in play at one time.
            Many artifacts also have Durability, similar to a Minion’s Health.
            For each point of damage dealt directly to a player, the most
            recently played Artifact’s Durability is decreased by one. Artifacts
            with Durability reduced to zero are placed in the Boneyard.{' '}

            Cards are divided into six colors, each corresponding with a Faction
            within the Mythgard universe:{' '}

            Blue – <strong>Norden</strong>

            Purple – <strong>Harmony</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            A card’s color determines which color gem it produces when burned.
            There are no restrictions on colors in deck construction, but
            because cards can only be burned once per game, decks frequently
            maintain concentrated color identities.

            In Mythgard you play with two different resources: Gems and Mana.
            Cards will have both a Mana and a Gem cost and some special
            abilities of cards will also cost Mana and Gems or sometimes both.
            At the bottom of your screen during a match you will find your
            resource bar, this will show your maximum and current mana on the
            left as well as your current Gems. Used gems will appear greyed out.
            Resources are spent automatically as you choose to play cards and
            abilities, and any used resources will be restored at the start of
            your turn. You gain both Gems and Mana by burning cards in your
            hand.

          <p>
            You can Burn a card once per turn by dragging it from your hand to
            the bottom of your resource bar during your turn. Burned cards are
            reinserted randomly into your deck, but are never placed directly on
            top. Burning a card will grant you 1 maximum Mana and 1 Gem of the
            card’s Faction. Faction is displayed on the colored strip which run
            through the middle of the card and Gem on the card’s right side. The
            ring around the mana cost in the upper-left corner also indicates a
            card’s Faction. Each card can only be burned once, once a card has
            been burned it will show the ring in the top left being broken as
            well as have a burned look around the edge of the card.

            To play a card, simply drag it onto the Game Board. If the card
            you’re playing, such as a Minion or Enchantment, goes into a Lane,
            you can drag it into the desired Lane. Alternatively, you can drag
            it to the center of the Game Board and target a Lane. Some cards
            such as Artifacts and untargeted Spells can simply be dragged onto
            the center of the Game Board. Any cards dragged to the center of the
            Game Board will highlight potential Lanes, Minions, Artifacts, or

          <p>
            Cards come in 4 rarities. You can find the rarity of a card by
            looking at the medallion in the top right corner of the card. Rarity
            will dicated how often you find cards in packs and in Gauntlet/Arena
            game modes. There are deck building restrictions and crafting costs
            based on rarity as well, which we will cover in the Deck Building
            Rules section later.

            In the deck editor you can create/edit/copy/delete your decks as
            well as view/copy your current featured decks. A deck must contain a
            minimum of 40 cards and can not contain more than 200.

          <p>
            In Mythgard, the rarity of a card limits the number of copies of
            that card you may put in your deck. They are as follows:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Common:</strong> 4x
            <br />

          <p>
            Essence is the crafting currency of Mythgard. Essence can be gained
            by unmaking cards you own and can be used to make cards you do not
            own. Cards of different rarities have different essence values
            associated with them. They are as follows:
          </p>

          <p>
            Commons: <strong>Unmake</strong> for <strong>10</strong> essence and
            cost <strong>50</strong> essence to <strong>make.</strong>
            <br />
            Uncommons: <strong>Unmake</strong> for <strong>20</strong> essence
            and cost <strong>100</strong> essence to <strong>make.</strong>

            Rares: <strong>Unmake</strong> for <strong>100</strong> essence and
            cost <strong>500</strong> essence to <strong>make.</strong>
            <br />
            Mythics: <strong>Unmake</strong> for <strong>600</strong> essence

          <p>
            Wildcards are a crafting resource that can be opened in packs or
            earned as Maat Rewards. Wild Cards have a specific rarity, card set
            and Faction associated with them. A Wildcard can be used to craft a
            card of the corresponding rarity, Faction and set instead of its
            essence cost. They can also be unmade for essence at double the
            standard rate of their corresponding rarity.
          </p>

          <p>
            After you have completed the start of your journey through Mythgard,
            you will also be given 3 special missions. These missions reward you
            with a total of 2 Mythic and 2 Rare wildcards that aren’t locked to
            any specific Faction, allowing you to create any card of those
            rarities you wish.

          <p>
            A pack of cards costs 1200 Coins and will normally contain 3
            Commons, 2 Uncommons and 1 Rare. Each rare has approximately a 10%
            chance to upgrade to a Mythic. The longer you go without a Mythic
            after 10 packs, the higher than upgrade percentage becomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            You cannot open a copy of a Mythic you already own unless you
            already own all Mythics but you can open additional copies of cards
            of other rarities.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to Mythics, you also have a small chance to replace any
            card in the pack with a Wildcard of the corresponding rarity or a
            Prestige card. Just over 14% of packs will upgrade one or more cards
            to Wildcards and the same is true of Prestige cards as well.

            become increasingly challenging as you work your way through
            gauntlets of 5, 7, and finally 9 matches, only advancing if you win.
            While the prizes are the same as other PvE matches, completing

            are free to enter with a 9 day cooldown which is reduced for each
            game played. If you want to end your run early, you can pay a fee in
            coins to re-enter, at which point winning 5 of your 9 matches will
            return your invested coin. Unlike Gauntlet, you will play all 9

            As mentioned above, because each complete Gauntlet run guarantees an
            unlocked Path or Power, this is by FAR the fastest method for
            unlocking all of the various elements of deck building. The
            completely free format is fun, though the AI doesn’t have quite the
            same killer instinct as human opponents. This is also a great way to
            get more familiar with cards in the Core Set, as you will be able to
            see many of them as you go through drafts and get to test drive many
